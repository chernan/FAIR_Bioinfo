	title = {Repeatability and {Benefaction} in {Computer} {Systems} {Research} — {A} {Study} and a {Modest} {Proposal}},
	abstract = {We describe a study into the extent to which Computer Systems researchers share their code and data and the extent to which such code builds. Starting with 601 papers from ACM conferences and journals, we examine 402 papers whose results were backed by code. For 32.3\% of these papers we were able to obtain the code and build it within 30 minutes; for 48.3\% of the papers we managed to build the code, but it may have required extra effort; for 54.0\% of the papers either we managed to build the code or the authors stated the code would build with reasonable effort. We also propose a novel sharing specification scheme that requires researchers to specify the level of sharing that reviewers and readers can assume from a paper.},

	abstract = {Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components—a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines—to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly.},
